# Divine Donors Crowdfunding Platform

## Problem Statement

Schools often lack access to spiritual wisdom literature, which is vital for instilling a healthy pride in native culture and heritage among students. Alumni and well-wishers may wish to contribute to their schools but lack an organized platform to do so effectively.

## Solution

Divine Donors is a crowdfunding platform designed to bridge this gap by enabling alumni to find their schools and sponsor spiritual literature as a gesture of gratitude. This platform facilitates the creation and sharing of campaigns, making it easy to raise funds and spread awareness.
